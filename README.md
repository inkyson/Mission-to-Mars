# **Mission to Mars**
## **Overview of Mission to Mars Project**
In this project, we created a web app using *Flask* to display data that we scraped from various sites for Mars information.  We used *Chrome Developer Tools* to identify HTML components, used *BeautifulSoup* and *Splinter* to automate the web scraping and used *Mongo* to store the data that we scraped.

## **Results**
The final poduct is a web app that is mobile-responsive, stylistic and provides up to date information with just a click of a button.
